# SM2I
## Both places at once
Ever tired of first checking the weather forecast for where you live,
just to have open the app again to check if it rains where you work?
Never again.
This app shows both places at once.

## Story behind
SM2I is wordplay of SMHI, the swedish weather institute. 
The letter 'H' sounds a lot like the number 2 in swedish.
